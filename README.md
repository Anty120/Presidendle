# Presidendle
Wordle Clone / Guessing Game But For U.S Presidents

Made With ReactJS

To run: 
1. Run ```git clone https://github.com/Anty120/Presidendle.git``` in your terminal.
2. ```cd``` into ```presidendle``` folder that is contained in this folder (note the lowercase).
3. Run ```npm i``` to install the node modules needed to run the program. Note this will take a while, no need to panic if it seems to hang, that's just how it is...
4. Run ```npm start```. Note this might also take a while at first, but shouldn't take as long as the previous step.
5. Profit!
